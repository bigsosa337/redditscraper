player first games seems to have made this decision to remove iron giant from the MultiVersus roster for the time being. players discovered multiple touch of death combos and infinite chain grabs with the massive fighter that were also simple to pull off. "you know you’d think they’d have figured that out during the games “beta” period” “open beta” would be the worst decision they made. it really was silly how they tried to gaslight their fans into thinking the previous release was always meant to be an open beta. i can understand them wanting to give the game another shot, but it really was silly. multiversus really on that any% glitchless speedrun to obscurity. what on earth have they been doing this last year?! Taking every mobile game monetization scheme they could think of and forcing it down the throat of the game lmao. the game tripped on its first launch and they took it offline to improve it. it's just a huge mess. i can't imagine anyone playing this game competitively right now. it's just feels like it's not even as clunky as it used to be. the beta was great, and i was actually optimistic about the year to revamp and upgrade. so much more of the "free to play/live service" garbage is shoved in your face. if you want a real fighting game, you'll have to pay for it. be king, but i would love a third-party spin to come out that doesn't die in 2 months. going to a multiversus tournament unironically seems like one of the bigger wastes. a lot of people do enjoy being the experimenter who gets to figure out "what's the most broken thing" the bones to be good, but it also feels very grindy right now. even like the battle pass and these are events seem like they take wayyyyyy too much time and effort to make noticeable progress. i think you gotta drip stuff out lil faster to keep people coming back each day. there was an independently organized tournament for multiversus, where someone was maining iron giant. while said tournament was ongoing, the developers temporarily disabled iron giant because of how busted it was. iron giant is a new character in the game with several bugged, or at the very least extremely overpowered combos. tournament organizer expect them to search the internet for any random website showing a potential event using the game? iron giant isn't new and was in the fake beta that was really a full release. when one character in a fighter tournament has severe balance issues the tournaments typically don't permit that character to be played. the game is honestly such a huge example of wasted potential. i emptied 100+ hours into the beta - sure it wasn’t perfect, but the mechanics were smooth and it was definitely on track. the game is honestly such a huge example of wasted potential. multiversus feels absolutely horrible compared to smash but people tell me they PREFER multiversus. i feel like i'm taking crazy pills when i tell people this game feels absolutely horrible compared to smash but people tell me they PREFER multiversus. multiversus just feels like a hodge podge of ideas with poor execution and a lack of cohesion. people like new games that aren't effectively solved for a couple reasons. people like new games that aren't effectively solved for a couple reasons. smash sucks to play on a switch because 90% of the people playing online are on wifi. other than the Xbox problems right now, the MVS online play is just better. trying to play Smash online is cumbersome even at the best of times, and that's with an OLED cabled. multiversus feels like dookie to anyone that’s played smash for a long time. the moves and movement don’t read well, etc. don’t get how people prefer this type of movement and physics. temporary disabled due to an infinite combo that had been discovered. use of the combo was banned via the tournaments rules, which is why he was still allowed. happened mid tournament when this happened, in the middle of a set involving a player who mains him. smoothbrains took the game offline and then relaunched it recently in a far shittier state. how is this game ever truly being competitive? it's a party game, a mobile game really This "game" is a joke. MV is so clunky and weird and WTF is the system that causes a slight pause on hit called? it's in other fighting games too like street fighter. brawlhalla just feels like i’m playing 70 different skins of the same character. the fact that the iron giant is a character in a fighting game is just wrong. devs make broken character. sloppy. the controls for this game. sloppy. the controls for this game. sloppy. every system they added to this launch is fucking garbage. 4 different currencies, a massive pve grind that is mind numbing. a patch and releasing a new version of the character with an explanation would be the better course of action. fun fact: online is completely unplayable on Xbox. good luck to anyone who hopes to finish the battle pass since you only earn xp from challenges which reset every week. hilarious that it happened, even more so because it happened live Can’t even play it on series x everytime there’s a big action moment game freezes and I end up off the screen and dead. i'm in with the idea that they ran the beta so they could figure out which features and characters to gut and sell back later. i was checking all my skins yesterday and realized my main wasn’t there and had to look it up. i hope this game bombs anyway so fortnite can get Warner (mainly wanting DC) characters again. ems like something zaslav would prefer anyways, selling IPs, rather than limiting them to internal games. as long as any subreddit is great for open discussions, these bots will be embarrassingly easy to spot.
