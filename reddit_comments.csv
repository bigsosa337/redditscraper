Player First Games seems to have made this decision to remove Iron Giant from the MultiVersus roster for the time being because players discovered multiple touch of death combos and infinite chain grabs with the massive fighter that were also simple to pull off.
"""Giant robot ruins fighting game with absurd combos"""
MVC2 fans: First time?
You know you’d think they’d have figured that out during the games “beta” period.
And here I thought taking the game down and retroactively declaring the full period of its early hype “open beta” would be the worst decision they made.
"I can understand them wanting to give the game another shot. But it really was silly how they tried to gaslight their fans into thinking the previous release was always meant to be an open beta. Don't mind the fact that they never mentioned it as such, and had multiple season passes during that time."
"I remember when I read the article saying ""Multiversus is going offline after a Beta period"" and I was so confused, since I (and literally everybody else) just considered it to be a full release."
Multiversus really on that any% glitchless speedrun to obscurity
I can already imagine a video essay titled “Multiverses: The game that died twice.” With “What went wrong?” In the thumbnail.
What on earth have they been doing this last year?!
Taking every mobile game monetization scheme they could think of and forcing it down the throat of the game lmao.
"They really dont want these games to be successful lmao, like why bother doing a sequel if youre going to just keep making it be dogshit."
"Edit. Wait, is this a sequel or is it still the same game thats been dogshit for awhile!? Im so lost."
Same game. It tripped on its first launch and they took it offline to improve it. This is the improved version.
"Warner Bros doesn’t want to be successful, have you seen them recently?"
I can't imagine anyone playing this game competitively right now.  It's just a huge mess.
"It really is.  I enjoyed the game a bit during its beta, but now it's just feels like it's not even as close to finished as it was back then."
"They released a beta that won fighting game of the year. Only to take it away and ""remake"" it. When all they did was spend that time squeezing every microtansaction system they could think of on top of it."
"For real. The beta was great, and I was actually optimistic about the year to revamp and upgrade. The result, while enjoyable in the right mood, is so disappointing. So much more of the ""free to play/live service"" garbage is shoved in your face."
"Smash bros will always be king, but I would love a third-party spin to come out that doesn't die in 2 months."
Everyone is allowed to spend their time how they’d like but going to a Multiversus tournament unironically seems like one of the bigger wastes.
"Some people like being the experimenter who gets to figure out ""what's the most broken thing I can do in this incredibly broken game"".  It isn't my cup of tea (I don't have the time to bug hunt that way) but a lot of people do enjoy that part of gaming."
This game feels like it has the bones to be good.  But it also feels very grindy right now.  I understand it's free so you gotta work at earning unlocks but even like the battle pass and these are events seem like they take wayyyyyy too much time and effort to make noticeable progress.  Like it shouldn't take hours upon hours to unlock a stupid emote that I'll likely never use.  I think you gotta drip stuff out a lil faster to keep people coming back each day
So…how’s that second Nick All Stars game doing? Any good?
I forgot that was a different game than this. Thought it was the exact same game. Damn.
So... if I'm reading all of this correctly.
"There was an independently organized tournament for MultiVersus, where someone was maining Iron Giant."
"Iron Giant is a new character in the game with several bugged, or at the very least extremely overpowered combos."
"While said tournament was ongoing, the developers temporarily disabled Iron Giant because of how busted it was, mad an announcement to the playerbase why they were doing it."
Did this tournament organizer expect them to search the internet for any random website showing a potential event using the game?
Iron giant isn't new and was in the fake beta that was really a full release. He was who I played mostly in the 'beta'
"Added to this, when one character in a fighter tournament has severe balance issues the tournaments typically don't permit that character to be played.  For example initially in Smash Bros tournaments Princess Peach was banned from play because of a severe imbalance on any levels that involved background vertical movement.  Just her ability to float and do combos in air made her the only choice on moving levels."
Eventually they just banned those levels and re-invited Peach.  And then eventually re-invited the levels but everyone maintained an honor system not to choose Peach.
You're correct
"The game is honestly such a huge example of wasted potential. I emptied 100+ hours into the beta - sure it wasn’t perfect, but the mechanics were smooth and it was definitely on track to be the best smash clone. Clearly WB wanted to prioritize on this and loaded it up with “micro” transactions ($10 per character LOL), and a nearly impossible to complete battle pass, it really is such a sad sight to see."
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when I tell people this game feels absolutely horrible compared to smash but people tell me they PREFER multiversus.
"Dafuk?  Like I honestly don't understand if people don't really get how ""good"" mechanics feel or something because, to me, Multiversus has a terrible sense of weight, velocity, and ""impact"" when you're doing things compared to Smash."
"Smash just feels ""right"".  The floatiness, the impact, the inertia you have as you move.  Nintendos design ethos with platformers transfers over well to Smash.  Multiversus just feels like a hodge podge of ideas with poor execution and a lack of cohesion."
People like new games that aren't effectively solved for a couple reasons.
"One, just delving into something new is interesting."
"Two, the skill field is wide open so people who are medium or low skill get to, for a while, believe they are not."
"Smash sucks to play on a Switch tho because 90% of the people playing online are on wifi, and the switch's weakest aspect is its online functionality."
"Other than the Xbox problems right now, the MVS online play is just better. Smash is a brilliant game. I don't deny that, even for offline play, but trying to play Smash online is cumbersome even at the best of times, and that's with an OLED cabled."
"At least for me, that's why I'm playing MVS n not Smash."
I think they want a smash bros that they have a good chance of being good at
"Haven’t played since the “beta” but you’re absolutely right. To anyone that’s played Smash for a long time, Multiversus feels like dookie. Everyone plays like Brawl Jigglypuff. There’s no commitment on ANYTHING, the moves and movement don’t read well, etc. don’t get how people prefer this type of movement and physics."
depressing
You Stay. I Go. No Following.
Title is a bit deceptive. He wasn't removed from the game exactly but temporarily disabled due to an infinite combo that had been discovered.
"Use of the combo was banned via the tournaments rules, which is why he was still allowed, but the dev made the decision to straight up disable him and it happened to be mid tournament when this happened, in the middle of a set involving a player who mains him."
"While I think that's a bit more understandable I don't see why he had to be removed from casual and local play instead of being just banned from competitive modes, except maybe that they don't have the technology in place to do so."
"I’m so confused, I remember playing this game like 2 years ago? How come it’s suddenly in the news"
"Because they took the game offline and then relaunched it recently in a far shittier state and said the previous release was an ""open beta."""
The suits behind this game was smoothbrains.
"Sorry but I just can't see this game ever truly being competitive. It's a party game, a mobile game really"
"This ""game"" is a joke."
